Conceptual model as single source of truth Identifier CMC-R1 Statement The UML conceptual model should be used as single source of truth. Checkable: NO Why: it is UML-specific. Title: Fixed UML interpretation Identifier CMC-R2 Statement: The UML conceptual model must have a fixed interpretation. Checkable: NO Why: it is Informative rule; mapping between model elements. Title: Element names and URIs Identifier CMC-R3 Statement: All UML Element names should be fit for URI generation with clear namespace organisation. Checkable: NO Why: it is currently unimplementable due to the complex regex required and an error with (py)SHACL-SPARQL, as reported on Discord. Title: Case sensitivity and charset Identifier CMC-R4 Statement: All UML Element names are case-sensitive and shall follow the CamelCase convention. Checkable: NO Why: Enforcing CamelCase with a regex match is challenging and may prove difficult to implement directly and correctly, making it susceptible to brittleness. Instead, our approach should involve an indirect check to ensure that no other characters are used for separation. Specifically, we can verify that classes start with a capital letter, and properties start with a lowercase letter. Although there is an overlap with CMC-R3, which specifies PascalCase for classes and camelCase for properties, the current implementation is hindered by the complexity of the required regex and an error with (py)SHACL-SPARQL, as reported on Discord. Title: Namespaces and prefixes in element names Identifier CMC-R5 Statement: Element names shall be organised by namespaces. Namespaces may be indicated through prefixes delimited by colon (:) character, forming qualified names. Checkable: NO Why: Not the domain of SHACL. Title: Rich annotations through tags Identifier CMC-R6 Statement: UML Tags can be conveniently used for annotating the Elements. Checkable: NO Why: It is UML-specific. Title: Explicit depiction of external dependencies Identifier CMC-R7 Statement: The UML diagrams should depict how the developed model relates to external (reused) models. Checkable: No Why: It is UML-specific. Title: Class inheritance Identifier CMC-R8 Statement: Ensure that the attributes and associations of a superclass apply to all its subclasses. Checkable: No Why: It is informative; design principle. Title: Abstract classes Identifier CMC-R9 Statement: Classes that are not intended to be instantiated directly can be marked as abstract. Checkable: No Why: Primarily specific to UML; not applicable in OWL and has not been observed in practice with SHACL. However, refer to dash-abstract-classes for further information. Title: Attribute definition and usage Identifier CMC-R10 Statement: UML Attributes shall be used to define properties taking simple datatype values. An attribute declaration should specify its datatype and multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Checkable: No Why: Primarily specific to UML; the conventions disallow the use of domain and range, making this inapplicable. Additionally, value ranges are not consistently specified in SHACL. Nevertheless, there might be the possibility to enforce that literal properties do not have object values and vice versa. Title: Multiplicity of attributes and connectors Identifier CMC-R11. Statement: The multiplicity of connectors and class attributes should be specified, indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. The cardinality shall be as permissive as possible in Core Vocabularies and as restrictive as necessary in Application Profiles. Checkable: No Why: Primarily specific to UML; validating the presence of maxCount is challenging because if UML specifies the value as '*' or 'n,' there is no restriction to be generated. Similarly, minCount is not consistently generated when minimum=0 is specified. Title: Connector definition and usage Identifier CMC-R12 Statement: UML Connectors shall be used to define relations and properties taking non-atomic type values. A connector declaration should specify multiplicity whenever possible [CMC-R11]. Checkable: No Why: It is UML-specific. Title: All elements are \"public\" Identifier CMC-R13 Statement: The visibility of all UML Elements should be \"public\". Checkable: No Why: It is UML-specific. Title: Controlled lists as Enumerations Identifier CMC-R14 Statement: The controlled lists of values shall be referred to as UML Enumerations and specified whenever possible. Checkable: No Why: It is UML-specific. Title: Partition the model into packages Identifier CMC-R15 Statement: Packages have no semantic value, but shall be used whenever possible to logically organise the model. Checkable: No Why: It is UML-specific. Title: Diagram readability Identifier CMC-R16 Statement: UML class diagrams shall be organised for readability. Checkable: No Why: It is UML-specific. Title: Element stereotypes Identifier CMC-R17 Statement: Stereotypes do not have semantic or normative value. They shall be avoided in the conceptual models unless a good motivation, and a strong need is provided. Checkable: No Why: It is UML-specific. Title: Datatype definition and usage Identifier CMC-R18 Statement: We strongly recommend that only OWL 2 compliant datatypes are used. The creation of custom datatypes shall be avoided. Checkable: No Why: Anything declared within standard namespaces (RDF(S)/XSD) is acceptable because no new (custom) definitions are introduced. This raises the question of new datatypes defined within these standard namespaces.","title":"Conceptual model conventions (UML)","component":"ROOT","version":"dev","name":"conceptual-model-conventions","url":"/dev/conceptual-model-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Conceptual model as single source of truth","hash":"sec:cmc-r1","id":1},{"text":"Fixed UML interpretation","hash":"sec:cmc-r2","id":2},{"text":"Element names and URIs","hash":"sec:cmc-r3","id":3},{"text":"Case sensitivity and charset","hash":"sec:cmc-r4","id":4},{"text":"Namespaces and prefixes in element names","hash":"sec:cmc-r5","id":5},{"text":"Rich annotations through tags","hash":"sec:cmc-r6","id":6},{"text":"Explicit depiction of external dependencies","hash":"sec:cmc-r7","id":7},{"text":"Class inheritance","hash":"sec:cmc-r8","id":8},{"text":"Abstract classes","hash":"sec:cmc-r9","id":9},{"text":"Attribute definition and usage","hash":"sec:cmc-r10","id":10},{"text":"Multiplicity of attributes and connectors","hash":"sec:cmc-r11","id":11},{"text":"Connector definition and usage","hash":"sec:cmc-r12","id":12},{"text":"All elements are \"public\"","hash":"sec:cmc-r13","id":13},{"text":"Controlled lists as Enumerations","hash":"sec:cmc-r14","id":14},{"text":"Partition the model into packages","hash":"sec:cmc-r15","id":15},{"text":"Diagram readability","hash":"sec:cmc-r16","id":16},{"text":"Element stereotypes","hash":"sec:cmc-r17","id":17},{"text":"Datatype definition and usage","hash":"sec:cmc-r18","id":18}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"Title: Data shape language choice Identifier DSC-R1 Statement: The data shapes shall be expressed in SHACL. Checkable: Yes, partially Validating that a Shapes file is indeed a SHACL Shapes file may perhaps be the subject of a syntax checker or another validation profile. It raises the question of whether to accommodate shape declarations and class definitions in the same file/graph, and also declaration styles where a class is also a shape (class extended shapes, which is in turn a subject of DSC-R4). Furthermore, a SHACL file is by extension also an OWL file. We can employ basic checks to ensure resource types are from either vocabulary, and that there exists at least one SHACL resource.

Checkable: No It is not possible to verify whether a vocabulary is a component of an Application Profile (AP). To implement such a check, options need to be provided, such as specifying an AP for validation. Nevertheless, identifying violations in shapes that adhere to or deviate from the AP will pose a challenge. Title: Open and Closed world assumptions Identifier DSC-R3 Statement: The data instantiating a core model may be fragmented across information systems. For representation purposes, open-world assumptions shall be adopted, and for validation purposes, a closed-world assumption shall be adopted. Checkable: No The open vs. closed world assumption is not easily verified in an automated manner. The conventions do not clearly articulate how this affects large ontologies, such as ePO. Title: Shape definitions Identifier DSC-R4 Statement: Each ontology class shall be mirrored by a sh:NodeShape. The property constraints may be embedded (contextualised) within node shapes or defined as freestanding. Checkable: Yes, partially The gist of the rule is two-fold: (i) every class must have a corresponding shape and (ii) property constraints can be \"freestanding\" or not. SEMIC does not make clear if the latter is to be recommended or avoided. The former would normally not be implementable, as we validate SHACL and OWL independently, but an idea for the future is to allow (provide an option for) a combined validation of both OWL and SHACL. There are other subrules, and one clearly implementable is that of avoiding class extended shapes (i.e. a shape that is also a class). Shapes File: : avoid_class_extension.shacl.ttl Shape Description(s): A node shape targeting the class sh:NodeShape with a property value type membership restriction to sh:NodeShape (effectively saying this is by no means an extended shape of any kind - not just OWL class) Non-Compliance Severity: Warning Non-Compliance Message(s): Non-observance of SEMIC rule DSC-R4: Avoid classes extended as node shapes. Title: Data shape severity Identifier DSC-R5 Statement: It is recommended to use constraint severity for distinguishing critical violations from non-critical recommendation warnings and from nice-to-have information. Checkable: Yes This is a rule which has syntax implications and therefore may be covered more extensively by a validator using a syntax profile. Shapes File: severity_declaration_exists.shacl.ttl Shape Description(s): A node shape targeting the class sh:NodeShape with a restriction of XONE (exactly or \"exclusively one of\") on two sets of property shapes: one on the property sh:severity with exact cardinality 1, and another on the sequence of properties (sh:property sh:severity) with exact cardinality 1, referring to any related property shape (effectively saying check that either one of these situations must exist).
