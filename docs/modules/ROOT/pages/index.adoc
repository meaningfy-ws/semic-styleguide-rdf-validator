= The SEMIC Style Guide RDF (OWL/SHACL) Validator

The SEMIC Style Guide RDF Validator is a project comprising a Python test suite and  configuration resources for an https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed[ITB] OWL/SHACL validator. The validator allows you to assess the conformance of an OWL model (ontology) or a SHACL Shapes file with the https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/guidelines-and-conventions.html[SEMIC Style Guide], a set of conventions for https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/semic-style-guide-semantic-engineers[semantic data interoperability]. For each guideline in the style guide, a set of rules have been implemented, which assess whether an OWL or SHACL convention is respected. These rules specify constraints on the structure, relationships, and properties within the models. This document describes the set of rules from the style guide employed for the validation.
